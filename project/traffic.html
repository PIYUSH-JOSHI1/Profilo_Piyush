                Project Objectives
                The Traffic Flow Optimization And Congestion Management project aims to revolutionize traffic management at intersections by leveraging advanced technologies such as real-time traffic density calculation and adaptive signal switching algorithms. By intelligently analyzing traffic conditions and dynamically adjusting signal timings, the project seeks to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance overall transportation efficiency. With the growing challenges of urban mobility and increasing traffic congestion, the project endeavors to provide a scalable and efficient solution for improving traffic flow and reducing travel times for commuters.
                
                
                
               
            </p>
            <p>
                Key Features
Real-time Traffic Density Calculation: Utilizes image processing and object detection techniques to accurately assess traffic density at intersections. This enables the system to make informed decisions about signal timing adjustments based on current traffic conditions. By continuously monitoring traffic flow and dynamically adapting to changing conditions, the system optimizes signal timings to minimize delays and maximize throughput.
Adaptive Signal Switching Algorithm: Dynamically adjusts signal timings based on real-time traffic data, optimizing green signal duration for each direction. By prioritizing lanes with higher traffic density, the system minimizes wait times and maximizes traffic throughput. The adaptive signal switching algorithm takes into account various factors such as traffic volume, vehicle types, and road geometry to optimize signal timings and improve overall traffic flow efficiency.
Simulation Module: Provides a visual simulation environment for evaluating system performance and comparing it with traditional static signal systems. Users can observe simulated traffic scenarios and assess the effectiveness of the adaptive signal switching algorithm under various conditions. The simulation module allows users to customize simulation parameters, such as traffic density, signal timings, and vehicle behavior, to simulate specific scenarios and analyze system behavior in detail.
